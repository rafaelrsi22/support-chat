# Support Chat

## What is this app ?

Basically Support Chat is a simple interface app for a Support Chat System.
The system is a chat that holds a interface that you can talk with authenticated members (Staff/Admins), and you only talk with them to ask some support in whatever application. Staff and Admins will be allowed to have more than one chat, becaus they need to talk with every common user, but common users will only have one chat, that any staff and admin can join it.

## Technologies Used

### Front-End

For the client side of the application, I am using React.js, and for the UI I got interessed into tailwindcss.

### Back-end

For the server side, I am using Express.js and MongoDB so, basically the app uses the MERN Pattern.
